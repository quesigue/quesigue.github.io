<p>The estancia is amazing. It’s more than we could have ever imagined. We’d hoped for a place to sleep (maybe on the ground, maybe with the horses) and here we are, having our own room, being spoiled EVERY single day, drinking wine, all day long riding horses and eating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_409" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 714px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P5041036.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-409 " alt="La Pelada" src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P5041036-1024x577.jpg" width="704" height="396" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">La Pelada</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>La Pelada (literally that means “bold” but can also be used as “nothing”; the estancia is called like that because when the first owner’s wife saw the place she said: ”Great, we have la pelada” because there was nothing – no trees, no hills – only flat land) is now owned by Agosto. He inherited it from his parents and with his friend, Dario, started the business. So, Agosto is giving the place and controlling if everything in the estancia works while Dario owns horses, brings the clients (he created the website <a href="http://www.gaucho-argentino.com/" target="_blank">http://www.gaucho-argentino.com/</a> and actually the business is run by him) and takes care of them in a very special way. He is very passionate about everything he’s doing, he gets to know every single client personally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the day we came here luckily there were no clients, so Dario could take us to the authentic countryside family. At first we were a bit scared and didn’t know how to behave (we looked really odd in our galactic leggings, you can imagine) but after a while we noticed how nice the people were and how well they treated us. Of course they were also laughing about us but we barely understood what they’re saying because they speak their own dialect – Guarani. However, Dario wouldn’t let them say anything bad about us. He’s highly respectable person in gaucho surrounding, he’s position is extremely high, we were actually a bit surprised how lucky we are hanging out with him!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_398" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_20130430_195227.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-398" alt="Gaucho´s family, where we were staying" src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IMG_20130430_195227-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Gaucho´s family, where we were staying</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those two days, we were living their way (the real gaucho life we had there) – getting up at 4:30 am, spending whole days on horses collecting cows in and out of their space, and during the brake  eating roasted lamb in the forest. Our legs and butts weren’t hurting that much because the saddles are soft, made of lamb’s fur and, what is more, is that the gaucho way of riding horses is totally different than the way people are being learned to ride in Europe. So we had to forget the old way and learn a new one, loosen our muscles and sit in the saddle like it is a sofa, in a very relaxed way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we came back to La Pelada  after those two days, there were some new people coming so we had to leave the room and move to the unfinished one (it didn’t have one wall so we were a bit afraid of the giant spiders or poisonous snakes coming in but none of that happened) but the food was still great, and we were still being treated like princesses and riding horses almost all day long every day. We had a little difficulty to leave this wonderful place.</p>
<p>Not only because it was so great it was difficult to leave  but also because of the bus strike going on in the whole Argentina! Right now we are again in Buenos Aires, waiting for the strike to calm a bit and thinking about how to go to Mendoza. Jeez, it’s time to leave this crazy country…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We attach photos <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.442070259216947.1073741832.421712874586019&amp;type=1" target="_blank">here</a> and some videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzTW0OuiSjBEHTl9Zw6qqwn-P3kN3cNvt" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzTW0OuiSjBEHTl9Zw6qqwn-P3kN3cNvt</a>  – we’re sorry about the quality of some of them but we forgot to turn something that is called a “western” mode off! They are also a bit horse-ish in the way they ‘jump’ up and down <img src='http://quesigue.pl/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />  but pls enjoy them anyway! BESSOS!</p>

<p>The Road to Iguazu wasn’t that bad. It was very long indeed, but we almost slept through it, because the coche-cama is really comfy. On this 20-hour long journey we’ve met Cedric, whom we knew from El Diablo Tranquilo hostel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Puerto del Iguazu we were at 10 am, so we decided to visit the famous waterfalls the very next day (it is recommended to be there as early in the morning as possible). So we went to see the town, found a cheap hostel and rest for a little bit. Our hostel had a pool and that was a bless since the temperature in the north of Argentina is really high. In the city itself, the main attraction is the place where you can see three countries  at once  &#8211; Argentina, Paraguay and Brasil -  separated only by two big rivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We started our visit in the Iguazu Park with a motorboat trip. That is an additional option we’ve decided to treat ourselves with. Boats take you near the waterfalls and offer you some showers. The first encounter with the waterfall was really freezing (we were cold even without it, because mornings there aren’t that warm). But the view from below was very impressive and the all thing was really worth doing it. Totally wet but happy, we went to see the whole park. We saw some nice species of animals like greedy raccoons, a wild turkey, a water turtle, a giant fish, a bird-model, multicolor butterflies and something similar to guinea pigs.. To be honest, we expected something more (some monkeys perhaps?). However, the waterfalls were breathtaking and the whole experience was very mystical. It is hard to describe this view, but what we can do is to recommend you to see the Garganta del Diablo at the very end of seightseeing.</p>

<p>For the last few days we were discovering the coast of Uruguay. We started in Colonia, where we’ve come by boat from Buenos Aires. Colonia was a refuge of peace and calmness after crowdy and noisy Baires, how the people call the capital of Argentina.. On the streets there was almost no one, only a few tourists walking around the old town. Beautiful colorful houses (summer houses rather than year-round), a small harbor with boats, tiny streets with benches decorated with ceramic tiles. We spent there only 2-3 hours walking, and from there we took a bus to the capital of Uruguay, Montevideo ie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_362" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/P4170370.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-362" alt="Typical street in Colonia" src="../wp-content/uploads/2013/04/P4170370-300x169.jpg" width="300" height="169" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Typical street in Colonia</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We had a little trouble with contacting our next host (our phone didn’t work, so we had to look for access to the Internet). Once we managed to get to the right apartment, it was not Mariano’s, with who we wrote, but his friend Santiago’s. Santiago was very hospitable &#8211; he gave us his room to sleep in, he agreed to keep our big backpacks at his place while we went to the coast of Uruguay, and told us  what to see in Montevideo. On the same day we met Mariano himself. His sense of humor made it difficult  for us to determine whether he is trustworthy. But that was just the first impression <img src='http://quesigue.pl/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We were sightseeing in Montevideo only for one day because boys were going to Punta del Este the next day and so we decided to go with them. They often go there for the weekends and this weekend was to be the last warm one before the upcoming winter. Moreover, the route recommended for us by Santiago included only the promenade by the sea and a few streets in the old town. Other areas on the map were marked by crosses (X-es) and that meant we shouldn’t go there. The promenade stretches the length of the whole Montevideo, so the people of each district gather there after work and do many activities like jogging, riding a bike, skating etc. We regretted , that we do not have a bike (28 degrees Celsius and the lack of shade for several kilometers can be tiring).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Old Town was quite empty. It wasn’t big at all, just several streets with pubs with steak next to  abandoned old houses with graffiti on them. Miel , about whom we wrote in the previous post, drew our attention to the artistry of the local graffiti artists. She admitted that when she travels she always pays attention to the steet art because they can say a lot about the habitants and the city itself.</p>

<p>The same day, late in the evening, we were already in the Mariano’s family countryside home, near Punta del Este and La Barra. In the morning we saw how beautiful the house is, with its glassy walls and an amazing view. And finally it was time for the beach and ocean! Over the next three days we visited various beaches (La Barra, La Pedrera, La Paloma) we were swimming, surfing, running and, OK., a little bit of frying at the beach too. A very enjoyable holiday.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Sunday, the guys had already come back to Montevideo, while we moved on to Punta del Diablo. We knew we wanted to stay in that very small town, because it was recommended to us by a few friends back in Poland. As soon as we got out of the bus, we asked a police officer  where is an open hostel here somewhere. Without a moment of hesitation he told us to go to El Diablo Tranquillo, and so that was the same place where two years earlier our good friend Franek stopped. 12.90 USD per night, including breakfast, a joint 10-person dorm, where besides us there was one girl from Brazil and one boy from England. As the hostel was also a bar, every night people were coming down there and talked until late. We met some people from England, New Zealand, Australia, Brazil, Argentina, Texas &#8230; and only one Uruguayan who was an employee of the hostel. Others who ran the hostel used to be turists who during their stay decided to prolong it and instead of a week or two, there are here for  few months now.</p>

<p>Although Punta del Diablo is a very small town, it offers a lot of attractions. Surfing, horse riding, scooters, a huge nature reserve, &#8220;black lake&#8221;, watching the sea lions (in nearby Cabo Polonia). We’ve decided to opt for a long walk (a bit TOO long actually) along the beach to the Santa Teresa reserve,  which in total had about 10 kms and took us six hours. However, the views and the smell of plants were amazing. Unfortunately, we had a less pleasant encounter with the animals .. We saw the first hairy, ugly spider (it was probably a real TARANTULA)! In the evening, we were so tired that we didn’t even have the strength to sit and talk in a common room &#8211; we only cooked our first self-made dinner (pasta with some delicious vegetables ) and tried the local wine from the box, which turned out not so bad. Even such a great news from Magda and Diego that they would willingly accomodate us on their ranch in Esquina  (in Argentina) and offer us a two-day horse-back trip, did not give us the strength to continue the evening. It was not until the morning we were able to fully enjoy that fact.</p>

<p>It is our last day in Uruguay today – we’re heading back to Santiago’s where we’d left our backpacks  and at 6.30 in the morning we have a bus  to Iguazu. It is going to be a very exhausting and long journey. We plan to see the famous waterfalls on Friday, and on Sunday we have to be in Esquina.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And here you can see the center of Punta del Diablo, as we waited for the bus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t195xyuL5F0&amp;feature=youtu.be. Another interesting landscape that we saw while travelling through Uruguay, were cows grazing among the palm trees. Very exotic view (unfortunately, the picture doesn’t show it good enough). More photos from Uruguay you can find on our website on Facebook.</p>

<p>Yesterday, when we were travelling from Colonia to Montevideo, we met Miel, a backpacker from San Francisco. She used to travel with her boyfriend (last time they travelled through Asia), but now she says that she prefers to travel on her own. And so she is exploring South America since December, and she&#8217;s going to stay on this continent until July next year. Her stories were very inspiring for us, so we were a bit mad on ourselves when we realized that she would be the perfect person to create a new sentence for <em>Que Sigue</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, we accidently met her today walking around the old town in Montevideo. We talked a bit more  and we asked her to participate in our game. That&#8217;s what she came up with: <em>Delightfully, some big cities have soft air with sounds that soothe and the chaos is found in the street art</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see, it&#8217;s getting more poetic, but we don&#8217;t mind at all. We would like to get such a personal sentences in the future, because they show person&#8217;s attitude and it&#8217;s interesting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an instant, we&#8217;re going to Punta del Este and some other small cities by the sea. It&#8217;s time to chill out for a bit and leave the big cities behind.</p>

<p>So here we are, in Buenos Aires. We arrived on Friday, the 12th. Sorry, to inform you so late, that we’re alive. Not only we are alive but also we’re feeling very good. As our first host, out of many many people who were interested in meeting us, we’ve chosen Lara Muriel, a lovely 22 &#8211; year old girl from the northern part of Argentina called Farmosa. She lives with her crazy cat, Fermina, in a flat near the center of Buenos Aires. As a first person we’ve met here, and, what is more, as our host, Lara was the one to create the second sentence for our game.</p>
<p>We’ve spent a lot of time together with Lara. As we haven’t really prepared a what-we-want-to-see list , she was a great guide, showing us places we wouldn’t have seen without her. We walked around different neighbourhoods, we saw and entered <i>La Casa Rosada</i> which is a pink building where the president works, we’ve met Mafalda, we ate <i>empanadas</i> (similar to pierogi) and chorizo-sandwiches (<i>choripan</i>) on the street. All this time we’ve been drinking <i>mate</i>, which is a typical tea-ish drink prepared from yerba mate, or its cold version – <i>terere</i>. In Argentina, when you’re invited to drink it you’re considered a friend. She really has taken good care of us THANKS LARA!</p>
<p>Lara wasn’t the only one spending time with us. Euge and Lucia, who Chapi’s met on a camp six years ago, were really interested in hanging out too! On our first day they invited us to dinner (we ate typical argentinian chuleta called <i>Milanesa</i> – it&#8217;s like wiener schnitzel but with extras like cheese, rucola, tomato, mushrooms etc., everything on top) and drived us around Buenos Aires. We were really tired, because for us it was like 4 a.m. but we really enjoyed it, despite the low temperature that night (around 12 degrees). The nicest thing for us was that we were invited to take part in an <i>ASADO</i>, a typical family barbecue, to Euge’s house. We’ve met her family and were able to practise some more spanish. It is getting better and better, by the way. At the <i>asado</i>, we ate a lot of different kinds of meat, salads, guacamole and drank some wine from Mendoza, the most famous wine-making region in Argentina. After that we’ve tasted (unfortunately we haven’t had much space in our bellies!) a delicious cake made of <i>dulce de leche</i> (mmmmm…) and chocolate cookies. Everything was really nice and the family was so kind and warm THANKS AGAIN GIRLS!<br />
After the <i>asado</i>, Euge and Lucia took us on a trip to see the Tigre region, where they used to camp for weekends and a beach near the river, where some people do kitesurfing.</p>
<p>Yesterday we went to Boca and took a lot of pictures beacuse this neighbourhood was so colorful! Yup, yesterday we were real <i>turistas</i>. After coming back to the apartment we were working on our posts and photos for the blog for a long time and in the evening we went out for the goodbye dinner. Tomorrow we have to get up very early because we’re leaving Buenos Aires and we’re taking a boat to Uruguay, where we already have a host.</p>
